# Automated release management using release-please
# Creates release PRs from conventional commits and generates changelogs
#
# How it works:
# 1. On every push to main, release-please analyzes commits since last release
# 2. If there are releasable changes, it creates/updates a Release PR
# 3. The PR contains auto-generated CHANGELOG entries
# 4. When the PR is merged, it creates a GitHub release with the tag
#
# Requires conventional commits:
#   feat: new feature (minor version bump)
#   fix: bug fix (patch version bump)
#   feat!: breaking change (major version bump)
#   docs:, chore:, refactor:, test: no version bump
