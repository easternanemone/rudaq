# DynExp Readme

**DynExp** is an open-source tool for highly flexible laboratory automation for dynamically changing experiments based on modern C++.

Its idea is rather simple: DynExp implements hardware and devices typically employed in (physics) labs.
It provides access to abstract and generalized instruments, which can use the hardware.
In turn, the abstraction of instruments enables to write hardware-agnostic programs to control and automate experiments, so-called modules.
This allows for greatest flexibility since the experiment modules do not depend on specific hardware.
Instead, instruments can be assigned to modules without any programming at runtime.
