## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Node-based visual editor chosen as primary interface (standard scientific workflow paradigm)
- One-way code generation established (visual is source of truth, code is export only)
- Parameter injection for live edits (RunEngine Checkpoint-based, structure immutable during execution)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
