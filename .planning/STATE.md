# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2025-01-22)

**Core value:** Scientists can design and interactively run experiments without writing code, while power users retain full programmatic control
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Node Graph Editor Core

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 10 (Node Graph Editor Core)
Plan: 1 of 4 complete
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-22 - Completed 02-01-PLAN.md

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 13%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 6.3min
- Total execution time: 0.5 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan | Status |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| 01 | 3 | 17min | 5.7min | ✓ Complete |
| 02 | 1 | 10min | 10.0min | In progress |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (6min), 01-02 (5min), 01-03 (6min), 02-01 (10min)
- Trend: Stable (longer plan due to integration work)

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Node-based visual editor chosen as primary interface (standard scientific workflow paradigm)
- One-way code generation established (visual is source of truth, code is export only)
- Parameter injection for live edits (RunEngine Checkpoint-based, structure immutable during execution)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
