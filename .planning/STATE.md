# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2025-01-22)

**Core value:** Scientists can design and interactively run experiments without writing code, while power users retain full programmatic control
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Form-Based Scan Builder

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Form-Based Scan Builder)
Plan: 1 of 2 complete
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-22 - Completed 01-01-PLAN.md (ScanBuilderPanel foundation)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 5%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 6min
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 1 | 6min | 6min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (6min)
- Trend: N/A (need more data)

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Node-based visual editor chosen as primary interface (standard scientific workflow paradigm)
- One-way code generation established (visual is source of truth, code is export only)
- Parameter injection for live edits (RunEngine Checkpoint-based, structure immutable during execution)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
