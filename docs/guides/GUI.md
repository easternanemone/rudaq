## GUI Documentation (Consolidated)

The detailed documentation for the egui desktop GUI has been consolidated into a single guide:

- See **`docs/guides/rust-daq-gui-guide.md`** for:
  - egui GUI architecture and panel layout
  - Event Log panel behavior and logging configuration
  - Real‑time plotting with `egui_plot` and Arrow
  - Instrument control panels and DAQ interaction

This file is retained only as a pointer to avoid duplicate/fragmented GUI documentation.
